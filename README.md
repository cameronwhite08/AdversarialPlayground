# MiniMaxPlayground

This started out as in in-class project in my school's Artificial Intelligence class CS4242. The goal was to create an implementation of the MiniMax algorithm to act as the adversary in ConnectR (connect 4 of various board sizes and win lengths)..

### Current Work
- Using minimax bot to create training data for a neural implementation of the TicTacToe adversary

### Future Plans
 - ~~Implement TicTacToe adversary~~
 - ~~Create phone app binding to play TicTacToe bot~~
